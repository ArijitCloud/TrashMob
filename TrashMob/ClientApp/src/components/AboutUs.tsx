                <h2>Where did the idea come from?</h2>
                <p>Years ago, Scott Hanselman at Microsoft built out the NerdDinner.com site as a demo of the capabilities of ASP.NET MVC. I actually went to a bunch of the nerd dinners in Redmond, WA which were fantastic
                and had a huge roll in my career, including eventually leading me to join Microsoft. This site is based on both that code and the idea that getting people together to do small good things
                    results in larger good things in the long term.</p>

                <h2>What is a Trashmob?</h2>
                <p>Fast forward to today, and my passion is fixing problems we have on the planet with pollution and climate change. I've been thinking about what technology can do to help in these areas,
                without creating more problems. And I keep coming back to the thought that a lot of this is a human problem. People want to help and they want to fix things, but they don't know where to start.
                    Other people have ideas on where to start, but not enough help to get started.</p>

                <p>In January 2021, I read about a guy in California named Edgar McGregor, who had, at that time, spent over 580 days cleaning up a park in his community, two pails of litter at a time, and I thought,
                that was a great idea. His actions inspired me to get out and clean up a local park one Saturday. It was fun and rewarding and other people saw what I was doing on my own and thanks me for doing it. It felt great.
                And then I passed by an area of town that was completely covered in trash and I thought "this is too much for me alone. It would be great to have a group of people descend on this area like a mob and clean
                    it up in an hour or two". And my idea for TrashMob.eco was born.</p>

                <p>Basically, TrashMob is the NerdDinner.com site re-purposed to allow people to start mobs of their own to tackle cleanup or <i>whatever</i> needs doing. And I keep coming up with more and more ideas for the site that will
                    allow it to grow organically because of the good that we can do we get together with a common goal.</p>
